  <h2>Love Letter from Ponnuh to Jibichaa</h2>
  <p>My Jibichaa, Happy Valentine's Day achayaa!! ❤️ First of all… congrats. Because out of all the people in this world, you got me as your Valentine. Massive achievement, honestly 😌😂 But jokes aside… I'm really grateful for you. Ninte presence ente life-il vannathinu shesham, everything feels lighter. Even on my worst days, nee onn konjicha mathi, mood reset aavum. That comfort? That's my favorite thing about you. I love how you care for me in small ways — random messages, silly teasing, checking if I ate, pretending to be strict but actually being soft inside. Athokke enikk valare special aanu. Sometimes I act strong and dramatic, pakshe truth paranjaal… ninne kittiyath enikk oru blessing aanu. You're not just my boyfriend, nee ente best friendum, safe placeum, happinessum aanu. Enikk big gifts onnum venda. Ninte time mathi. Ninte love mathi. Ninte koode future imagine cheyyan pattunnath mathi. So officially asking… Will you continue being my Valentine? (Answer correct aayirikkam. No negative marking, but still… choose wisely 😌😂) Always yours (slightly crazy, fully in love), Ponnuh 💘</p>
